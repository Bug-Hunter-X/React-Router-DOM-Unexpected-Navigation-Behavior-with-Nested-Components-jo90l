# React Router DOM Unexpected Navigation Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Router DOM v6 related to unexpected navigation behavior when using nested components.  Navigation sometimes fails to correctly update the DOM, leading to inconsistencies in the displayed content.

The issue is likely related to how React Router handles component updates in nested structures when routes change.  The provided `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents a potential solution.

## How to reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory `bug`.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Observe the navigation behavior between the Home and About pages. The unexpected behavior will manifest inconsistently.

## Solution:

The `bugSolution.js` file contains a potential solution to the issue.  The solution involves improving the management of component updates within nested components or potentially utilizing React Router v6's `useLocation` hook to refresh the state more explicitly.
